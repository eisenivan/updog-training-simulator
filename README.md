# Updog Training Simulator

## What is this?

Imagine this scenario.

Someone comes up to you and says "Bro, there is a huge updog back there". You have no idea what an updog is, so you respond predictably, "what's updog?". You have taken the bait. A huge smile pours over the face of your attacker. "Nothing man, what's up with you" is his reply.

Updog jokes don't always need to go badly however. Imagine this scenario.

Someone comes up to you and says "Bro, there is a huge updog back there". You have no idea what an updog is, so you respond predictably, "what's updog?". He looks at you. "I think updog is the first name of the author who wrote the book `The Jungle`".

"That's not right", you say. "You're thinking of `Upton`", but you sense the game. Now it is your turn. "I think updog is what you would call installing a 1TB SSD in place of a 256GB platter drive".

"No", he responds. "You're thinking of `upgrade`.

This game exists to train you for this second version of the updog game.

### Prompts

We're looking for prompts. Be creative. The three types of clues we are looking for are `Up<something>` ex. `Updraft`, `<something>dog` ex. `hotdog`, and `<direction><animal>` ex. `left shark`. Any submissions will be considered however. If you think it might be a stretch, feel free to include a comment as to why your clue works. Prompts can be found in `./prompts.json`. Each prompt needs a word, a clue, and a hint. Check the existing ones for more info.

### Game play
